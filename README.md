# Categorical-Features-Encoding-Project

The purpose of this project is to build machine learning skills by trying different encoding schemes, trying different ways to impute missing values and comparing performance of different classification algorithms using the methods of PySpark ML library. 
The project is based on the artificially created training and test datasets where every feature is categorical and the target variable is binary. The datasets can be downloaded from

The main goal is to see how convenient PySpark classification algorithms are, and how well they perform on a single machine when applied to relatively small datasets.
